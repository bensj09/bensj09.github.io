  <h2>Background Information:</h2>
    <p>I am a student at Eastern Washington University Studying Computer Science and Geographical Information Systems. I initially recieved a major in Political Science from Carroll College in Helena, MT. However, I soon realized that that was not the path I wanted to take and took some time to discover my true path which led me back to my love of computers. Two years later and I have found that my understanding of computers has improved exponentially and I see the value of programming everyday in systems we use all around us.</p>

    <h2>Professional Objectives:</h2>
    <p>I believe my current passion lies around working with an awesome team in programming. I love to code in Java and with the addition of C, HTML and CSS I know there isn't a limit to what languages I could learn. I hope that even after I graduate I will continue to learn more and more as I develop my skills in a professional setting.  </p>
