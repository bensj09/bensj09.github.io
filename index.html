<h2>Bio:  I&#39;m a 25 Year old  Computer Science Student at EWU. I decided to become a Computer Science major as a new approach in life. I already recieved a degree in Political Science and came to the conclusion that that was not what I really wanted to do in life so I decided to join a field that was extremely flexible in its use. That way I could have an easier time finding out what part of Computer Science I like the most and to this day I&#39;m still learning.</h2>
